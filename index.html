        <p id=p1>Feed the Future is a nonprofit organization that aims to break the cycle of child poverty that is so prominent in England today. Poverty is the single greatest threat to childrenâ€™s well-being, but not enough is being done to combat this issue. At Feed the Future, we believe we can break this cycle by setting children up for success by providing foundational support early on.
        <br><br>
        Our after school program provides children facing poverty with resources and support that they may not be receiving at home. We believe that education and nutrition are two of the most important and foundational needs children have. Because of this, our after school program provides students with educational support as well as nutritious meals.</p>

        <p id=p1>Feed the Future was founded by Claire Foster, who grew up in Manchester, England. She was the oldest of six children. From looking after her younger siblings and helping them with their schoolwork she realized she had a love of helping children learn and grow. This inspired her to study education. Her first teaching job was located near Liverpool where many of the families struggled to make ends meet. Due to her passion for helping children she committed much of her free time to providing tutoring to many of her students after school. This led to her realization that children benefited from the extra support that they were unable to receive at home. 
        <br><br>
        Seeing the success of her tutoring efforts, she wanted to expand her sphere of influence. To do this she worked with fellow teachers to implement an after school program that provided students facing poverty with additional support. Their program started with just extra tutoring help but has grown through the support of volunteers and has now expanded to include feeding the students a meal before sending them home.</p>
